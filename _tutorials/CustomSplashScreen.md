## Custom Splash Screen
In this tutorial, i will show you how to customize the splash screen in Minecraft 1.2 beta on any Android device.files
The splashscreen is stored in it's own resource pack which is loaded as soon as the game starts up, and then the game loads the vanilla resource pack in the background.
<br>
#### 1. Extract the APK contents
This is pretty straight forward. An APK is basically a ZIP file, so just rename the extension to `.zip` and extract to somewhere you can find it.
<br>
#### 2. Locate the file
Next, you need to actually find the splashscreen image. It can be found in `assets/resource_packs/vanilla_loading_screens/textures/ui/loading_screen_0.png`.  
Now simply overwrite it with your new splashscreen and move on to the next step!
<br>
#### 3. Sign the APK
Firstly, download [ZipSigner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kellinwood.zipsigner2&hl=en&referrer=utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26utm_term%3Dzipsigner&pcampaignid=APPU_1_kuWAWcPiK8PRwQKJlIa4AQ).  
While that's downloading you can go into the folder you extracted the APK contents into and select every file (Don't select the folder; select all the folder contents) and compress them into a ZIP file.  
Now that ZipSigner is downloaded, open it and select the ZIP file you just created and hit sign!
