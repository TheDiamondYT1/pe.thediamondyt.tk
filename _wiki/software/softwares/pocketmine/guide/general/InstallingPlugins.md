## Installing plugins

There are multiple sources of which you can download plugins. The recommended one is [Poggit](http://poggit.pmmp.io/pi), but there are others to choose from:

* [The old plugin repository](http://plugins.pocketmine.net)  
* [ImagicalMine](https://imgcl.co/plugins/)/ 
* [Github](https://github.com/search?l=PHP&q=pocketmine+plugin&type=Repositories&utf8=✓)  

Once you have downloaded a plugin or two, find the directory where they were download to (most likely the Downloads folder) then copy to the `plugins` directory in your server.

Your directory structure should look like this:
```
- PocketMine-MP/
  - plugins/
    - MyPlugin.phar
```
