PocketMine-MP is a server software for Minecraft PE and was originally created to be a proof of concept.

#### PocketMine Realms
PocketMine Realms was a free service created by shoghicp (Shoghi Cervantes) on June 19th 2013.
It enabled the connecting to online servers through the MCPE 0.7.0 realms interface. 

Around August 31th 2013, PocketMine Realms was shut down due to a petition by Mojang. In return, they would add external server support MCPE.

You can view a snapshot of the PocketMine Realms site [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130811232607/http://realms.pocketmine.net/).  
And you can view a snapshot of the site after the service had closed [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131001030747/realms.pocketmine.net).  
I have also de-signed the .mobileconfig that PM Realms used for iOS [here](http://dl.thediamondyt.tk/realms.mobileconfig).
