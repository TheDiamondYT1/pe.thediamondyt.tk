PocketMine-MP is a server software for Minecraft PE and was originally created to be a proof of concept.

#### PocketMine Realms
PocketMine Realms was a free service created by shoghicp (Shoghi Cervantes) on June 19th 2013.
It enabled the connecting to online servers through the MCPE 0.7.0 realms interface. 

Around August 31th 2013, PocketMine Realms was shut down due to a petition by Mojang. In return, they would add external server support MCPE in version 0.7.4.
After this, the service was closed and users were recommended to use PocketMine-MP, as we know it today.
