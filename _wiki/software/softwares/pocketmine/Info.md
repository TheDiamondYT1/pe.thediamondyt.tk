PocketMine-MP is a server software for Minecraft PE and was originally created to be a proof of concept to document [wiki.vg](http://wiki.vg). Don't believe me? Check out [this commit](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/1b3568301299cc0c2fc832c5c2fc93326abc565d). It was also originally called `Pocket-Minecraft-PHP` and was renamed on December 22nd, 2012.

#### Shoghi's Departure
On (date), the founder of PocketMine shoghicp revealed that he had been offered a job a Mojang, and he took it. In the weeks and months that followed we saw no activity from him on the PocketMine Forums and he ignored every tweet asking about PocketMine, and the project slowly died. [This](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/cf3d8f449e05f5f540f88ce50609dff372a01445) seems to be the last commit by shoghi.<br> 
Then, on September 6th, 2016, our saviour Dylan K. Taylor (dktapps) took over the project. Website, forums, github â€” all fresh and new.

#### PocketMine Realms
PocketMine Realms was a free service created by shoghicp (Shoghi Cervantes) on June 19th 2013.
It enabled the connecting to online servers through the MCPE 0.7.0 realms interface. 

Around August 31th 2013, PocketMine Realms was shut down due to a petition by Mojang. In return, they would add external server support MCPE in version 0.7.4.
After this, the service was closed and users were recommended to use PocketMine-MP, as we know it today.
