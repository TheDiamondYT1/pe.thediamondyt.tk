## Patch Notes
This endpoint returns the patch notes for the specified client version. 

It requires 2 seperate requests to actually obtain the content.

|Host|Authentication|
|----|--------------|
|xforge.xboxlive.com:443|No|

### Making the requests
This may be slightly harder for beginners, and i haven't it explained it that well. You have been warned.

First, we make a `POST` request with some basic information.

#### Constructing the JSON payload
  
```
POST /v1/catalog/items/search
```
  
##### Headers
```
Content-Type: application/json
```
  
##### Payload
```
{
    "count": true,
    "filter": {
        "contentType": "PatchNotes",
        "platforms": ["minecraft"],
        "tags": ["{clientVersion}"],
        "titleId": "{titleId}"
    }
}
```
  
**Explained**  
* `{clientVersion}` is the version of the client.  
* `{titleId}` im not quite sure about at the moment, see example below.  
  
##### Example from client
```
POST /v1/catalog/items/search/ HTTP/1.1
Host: xforge.xboxlive.com:443
Authorization:
Cache-Control:public
Content-Length:117
Content-Type:application/json
User-Agent:cpprestsdk/2.8.0
Connection: Keep-Alive

{
    "count": true,
    "filter": {
        "contentType": "PatchNotes",
        "platforms": ["minecraft"],
        "tags": ["1.0.6"],
        "titleId": "896928775"
    }
}
```

Once you have done that, you will get a response that looks somewhat like the following:

```
{
    "count": 1,
    "facets": null,
    "results": [
    {
        "score": 1.0,
        "document": {
            "documentId": "G009SWL69327_ModSkuId_",
            "productId": "G009SWL69327",
            "title": "1.0.6 Update",
            "description": "",
            "contentType": "PatchNotes",
            "titleIds": [896928775],
            "platforms": ["minecraft"],
            "tags": [
                "1.0.6",
                "1.0.6_development"
            ],
            "version": "1",
            "parentIds": [],
            "visibility": "Public",
            "creatorId": "2535448579972708",
            "creatorGamertag": "DampKeyboard157",
            "thumbnailUrl": "https://ugcorigin.s-microsoft.com/12/67f58e36-06ab-4639-97dd-4a51ac1df0d7/550/profile.jpg",
            "creationDate": "2017-04-06T17:36:18.257+00:00",
            "lastModifiedDate": "2017-04-06T17:45:27.124+00:00",
            "isTestContent": false,
            "custom": {
                "offer": "chinesemythology"
            }
        }
    }]
}
```

##### Explained
* `productId` is the resource id of the patch notes content, see below  
* `title` is the title displayed in the patch notes screen  
* `creatorGamertag` is the xbox live gamertag of the content author  
* `offer` is the offer to be displayed in the top right corner of the patch notes screen  
  
<br>
Now we can get ready to make the `GET` request. In the JSON that we just received, find the `productId` field and add it to the URL as shown below.

*xforge.xboxlive.com:443/v1/catalog/items/{productId}*

Im not sure what the product id is, so heres an example one from the client: `G009SWJHK75F`.
  
```
GET /v1/catalog/items/{productId}
```

##### Headers
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

which returns something like

```
{
    "id": "G009SWL69327", 
    "title": {
        "neutral": "1.0.6 Update" 
    },
    "description": {
        "neutral": ""
    },
    "contentType": "PatchNotes", 
    "titleIds": [896928775], 
    "platforms": ["minecraft"], 
    "tags": [
        "1.0.6",
        "1.0.6_development"
    ],
    "sandbox": "RETAIL", 
    "version": "1",
    "minimumClientVersion": null,
    "parentIds": null,
    "creationDate": "2017-04-06T17:36:18.2575164+00:00",
    "lastModifiedDate": "2017-04-06T17:45:27.1240322+00:00", 
    "startDate": "2017-04-06T17:36:18.2575164+00:00",
    "visibility": 1,
    "contentUrls": [ 
        "https://ugcorigin.s-microsoft.com/15/26576bf3-0000-0000-7a48-6505c52535f9/680/mod.mod"
    ],
    "contents": [
    {
        "contentId": "26576bf3-0000-0000-7a48-6505c52535f9",
        "contentType": "publicmod",
        "contentUri": "https://ugcorigin.s-microsoft.com/15/26576bf3-0000-0000-7a48-6505c52535f9/680/mod.mod"
    }],
    "creatorId": "2535448579972708",
    "creatorGamertag": "DampKeyboard157", 
    "isTestContent": false,
    "images": [
    {
        "uri": "https://ugcorigin.s-microsoft.com/12/67f58e36-06ab-4639-97dd-4a51ac1df0d7/550/profile.jpg",
        "imagePurpose": "Thumbnail",
        "height": -1,
        "width": -1,
        "fileSizeInBytes": -1
    }],
    "commerce": {},
    "custom": {
        "offer": "chinesemythology"
    }
}
```
  
Now we can get the compressed patch note files. In the JSON we just received, find the `contentUrls` array and download the file from the URL provided.

The file downloaded is actually a compressed zip file, despite the exstension being `.mod`, so just rename it.
