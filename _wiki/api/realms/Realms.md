## Realms API
Mojang have a private API for interacting with their Realms servers. Here i will try to work out what all the fields mean so people can make their own API clients.  
Unfortunatly this requires Xbox Live authentication, and i don't know how to do that.

### Endpoints

* [Client Compatible](client-compatible/)
* [List Worlds](list-worlds/)  
* [New Trial](new-trial/)  
* [List Endpoints](list-endpoints/)  
* [Pending Invites Count](invites-count/)

I am not completely sure if any of this information is correct.
